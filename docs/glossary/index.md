# Glossary

This chapter provides a comprehensive advanced consensus of the FISCO BCOS (FISCO BCOS) blockchain ecosystem.

We'll start with the fundamentals of FISCO BCOS accounts, including their data structure, types, key pairs, and creation processes for both externally-owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts.

Next, we'll dive into FISCO BCOS transactions, outlining their prerequisites, data structure, and lifecycle.

Additionally, it explores transaction fees, including gas prices, gas usage, gas limits, and FISCO BCOS-specific gas configurations.

The roles and operation of nodes within the network are discussed, along with consensus algorithms like PBFT and PoS-rPBFT.
